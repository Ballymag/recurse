# recurse

The recurse package computes revisitation metrics for trajectory data, such as the number of revisitations for each location as well as the time spent for that visit and the time since the previous visit. Also includes functions to plot data.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
data(martin)
revisits = getRecursions(martin, radius = 2)
plot(revisits, martin, legendPos = c(10, -15))

```
